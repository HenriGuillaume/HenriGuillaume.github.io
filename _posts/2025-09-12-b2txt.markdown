This post is a wrapper for a report (written in [typst](https://typst.app/)!!!) about an extension of the work I did during my internship at [Institut de l'Audition](https://www.institut-audition.fr/).
Since speech reconstruction is the central theme of this work, I have included some audios at the end of this post.

# Results: audio reconstruction from neural features
To demonstrate that the approach is indeed viable, here are some examples of _unseen_ audio from the _validation set_. **Please keep in mind that:**
- This is a work in progress, I have not yet refined model architecture and optimized hyperparameters.
- This is not the best performing example of the validation set. Examples that are phonetically closer to training data enjoy a near-perfect reconstruction for _all_ layers.
